SELECT 
    *
FROM
    drivers;
    
#### Using Window Function
	
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS total_rides, SUM(CASE WHEN end_loc = next_start_location THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS profit_rides
FROM (
  SELECT *, LEAD(start_loc, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY start_time ASC) AS next_start_location
  FROM drivers
) A
GROUP BY id;

#### Using Self Join

WITH rides AS (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY start_time ASC) AS rn
  FROM drivers
)
SELECT r1.id, COUNT(1) total_rides, COUNT(r2.id) AS profit_rides
FROM rides r1
LEFT JOIN rides r2
ON r1.id = r2.id AND r1.end_loc = r2.start_loc AND r1.rn + 1 = r2.rn
GROUP BY r1.id;
